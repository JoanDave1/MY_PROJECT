### 1. Introduction
1.1 Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to uncover valuable insights into age-related trends, order quantity patterns and revenue generation. This analysis aims to:

- Help us understand the relationship between age categories and order quantities.
- To determine the most profitable age groups and locations.
- To analyze the impact of order location on revenue generation.

By harnessing the power of data visualization and statistical analysis using microsoft excel, we can provide actionable recommendations to inform business strategies, optimize marketing efforts and consequently drive business growth.

### 2. Data Description

2.1 Introduction

This data set contains records of customer information regarding beer consumption for 2024. It includes age, gender, order quantity, order quantity status, total revenue and ship date. There are no missing or duplicate values in this data set.

2.2 Variables

The variables in this dataset are:
- Age (numerical, ranges 18-28, 29-39, 40-50, 60 or above)
- Location (categorical, region/nation)
- Order quantity (numerical)
- Order quantity status (categorical, [low, medium, high])
------
### 3. Comparative Analysis

#### Age Category vs Order Quantity

3.1 Objective

To compare the order quantity across different age categories and give meaningful interpretation to results.

3.2 Methodology: 

- This data is grouped by age category. 18-28, 29-39, 40-50 and 60 or above.
- Data visualization using a pie chart.

3.3 Results

Results from our pie chart show that the age categories 18-28 and 40-50 have the highest percentage of beer ordered and consumed with an impressive 30% each, followed closely by the age group 29-39 with an equally impressive 26% and lastly 60 or above with 14%. 

3.4 Conclusion 

The comparative analysis reveals that the younger and middle aged customers from age 18-28 and 40-50 tend to order more beer than people in the age groups; 29-39 and 60 or above. This could be due to various factors such as:

- 18-28: Young adults may be more likely to socialize and engage in activities that involve beer consumption, such as parties, sport activities and so on. Hence a higher order percentage.
- 40-50: Middle aged adults may have established social networks and enjoy socializing over beer, or may have developed a taste for beer over time. Hence a higher order percentage.

Age group 29-39 has a slightly lower percentage compared to age groups 18-28 and 40-50. This could be due to a number of reasons.

- Life Stage: People in their 30s tend to  have more responsibilities such as raising a family or building a career. This may lead to a reducved income and less timr for socializing and consuming beer.
- Social Dynamics: People in their 30s may lay more emphasis on family and work-related socializing, rather than going out with friends to drink beer.
- Economic Factors: Reduced disposable income due to several expenses could lead to lower purchase and consumption of beer.

Age group 60 or above has the lowest order quantity of beer, which may indicate the following:

- Older adults may be less likely to socialize or engage in activities that involve beer consumption.
- They may have health considerations that affect their drinking habits.
